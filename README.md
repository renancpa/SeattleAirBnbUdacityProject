Motivation
This project aims to describe pricing trends and predict a expected pricing listing on AirBnb in Seattle based on a study on the dataset that describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

Content
The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:

Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
